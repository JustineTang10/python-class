'''I normally just list possible bugs in my head, or search for them depending on the program. But here's the turtle program.'''
def pseudocodeturtle():
  import turtle
  turtle = turtle.Turtle()
  turtle.shape('turtle')
  turtle.color('green')

  def pseudocode1():
    for i in range(6):
      turtle.fd(100)
      turtle.left(60)
  
  def pseudocode2():
    for i in range(26):
      turtle.circle(100)
      turtle.right(10)
  
  pseudocode1()
  turtle.clear()
  pseudocode2()
 
#Study Group: Binary Search
'''
Answers to study group question in email:
1. Finding a specific value in a sorted list quickly: like the Khan Academy link said, searching for a single value out of more than 2 million values.
2. Well, kind of the same answer as #1. You can use it to find a specific value in a sorted list quickly.
3. Does the code below count?
'''
def binarysearch():
  goalnumber = random.randint(1, 1000)
  min = 1
  max = 1000
  tries = 0
  print("The goal of this program is to guess a randomly chosen number from 1 to 1000.")
  while True:
    tries += 1
    middle = round((min+max)/2)
    if middle > goalnumber:
      max = middle - 1
    elif middle < goalnumber:
      min = middle + 1
    else:
      break
  print("It took",tries,"tries to find the number between 1 and 1000.")
